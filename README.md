# **Chainalysis Take Home Project**

## Created single page application with React frontend and Express/MongoDB backend.

### Application utilizes two crypto pricing exchange's API to pull in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices, then sends the instance to the backend to store, and is then recalled to display.

### After the last prices are recalled, they are displayed and the page provides recommendations (with links) to which exchange is better to buy or sell on.
